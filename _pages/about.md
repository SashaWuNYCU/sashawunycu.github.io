I am currently a Senior Engineer at the Econometrics Quantitative Analysis Lab of Walsin Lihwa Corp. My role involves applying mathematical models to optimize decision-making and automate processes. In 2021, I resumed my PhD studies at NYCU with GPA = 4.3 and passed qualify exam on my first attempt. I am now in the final stages of completion for my PhD. In 2024, I was invited by the Dept. of Stat. at NTPU to serve as a adjunct faculty,offering courses such as Causal Inference and Python Programming. In addition, I was also invited by the JCSA to serve as a Peer Reviewer.
